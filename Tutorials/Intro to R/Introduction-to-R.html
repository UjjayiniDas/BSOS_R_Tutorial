<h2>Introduction to R</h2>
<p>In this module, you will learn how to use the programming language,
R, to analyze data. While there are many programs we could use, R has a
few advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>FREE (other statistical programs can cost thousands of
dollars!)</li>
<li>R is Open source, so we can see the code. This contributes to Open
Science (which is a good thing)</li>
<li>It also means that researchers contribute coding packages, so it’s
easy to calculate many types of statistics and know exactly what you’re
doing</li>
<li>Nice and sophisticated graphs</li>
<li>Easy to reuse code (save time) and share (transparency in
research)</li>
</ul>
<div id="section-r-studio" class="section level3">
<h3>R-Studio</h3>
<p>RStudio is the most commonly used integrated development environment
(IDE) for R. In other words, it is the most common way that people use
to interact with R and write R code. In fact, you probably used RStudio
and had to run some code in order to access this tutorial. We won’t work
within the RStudio environment for these tutorials directly, but it’s
worth getting to know it a little bit.</p>
</div>

<ul>
<li><strong>Top Left</strong>: R Markdown File: This is where you will
answer questions and write code for R assignments. Anything you write in
this Top Left window will save when you exit out of R</li>
<li><strong>Bottom Left</strong>: Console: This is a little like scrap
paper. You can use this to try to answer questions or to write code, but
anything written in this area will <strong>NOT</strong> save. This means
we won’t be able to grade anything written in this section!</li>
<li><strong>Top Right</strong>: Environment (and some other things): The
top right section will be blank for now, but any variable you make or
any data set you upload will be saved here.</li>
<li><strong>Bottom Right</strong>: Everything else: There are several
tabs you can open in this section. If you make graphs, you will be able
to see them here(on the “Plots” Tab. Additionally, the “Help” tab will
give you more information about the functions we will use in R.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="section-running-code" class="section level3">
<h3>Running Code</h3>
<p>How do we get R to give us answers to our codes? We need to tell it
to “run” our code. We can do this by using the “Run” button. We can also
run code by putting our cursor on the line we want to run and pressing
“Command(Mac)/Control(PC)” and “Return/Enter”.</p>
<p>Try running the following calculation examples</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Addition
5+2</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 7</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># Subtraction
10-4</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 6</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># Multiplication
4*7</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 28</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># Division
105/5</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 21</code></pre>
<p><em>Note: The <code>#</code> symbol is a way of “commenting” your
code.It is like putting a little description on what you are doing in
those lines. Anything after the <code>#</code> symbol in R won’t be run
and will be ignored. You can use it to describe what is going within the
code.</em></p>
<p>Try doing some arithmetic on your own in the box below. You can run
the code by clicking on the blue “Run Code” button at the top right of
the box below.</p>

<div id="section-functions" class="section level2">
<h2>Functions</h2>
<div id="section-section" class="section level3">
<h3></h3>
<p>Much of what you do in R will involve using
<strong>functions</strong>. Let’s take a look at a simple function.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>print(&#39;Hello&#39;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;Hello&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Here, we are calling a function called <code>print</code>. This
function takes in one argument, or input: <code>'Hello'</code>. The
arguments go inside parentheses, and provide the input values. The
function then takes that input and performs some sort of action. In this
case, as you might have guessed, the <code>print</code> function prints
out whatever is provided as input.</p>
<p>Try writing some code yourself to print out a message of your choice.
Note that the text you want to print out has to be in quotes, though it
doesn’t matter whether it’s double quotes (<code>"</code>) or single
quotes (<code>'</code>).</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="printing_practice"
data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0">
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"Print"}</script>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-data-types" class="section level3">
<h3>Data Types</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, the text we wanted to print has to be in
quotation marks. This is because we want to create what is called a
<strong>string</strong> object. In R, it is also called a
<strong>character</strong> object. These are objects that represents
<strong>words</strong>, as opposed to <strong>numeric</strong> objects
which represent <strong>numbers</strong>. Essentially, the quotation
marks tell R to treat whatever is inside as a <strong>character
value</strong>.</p>
<div class="panel panel-default tutorial-question-container">
<div data-label="function" class="tutorial-question panel-body">
<div id="function-answer_container" class="shiny-html-output"></div>
<div id="function-message_container" class="shiny-html-output"></div>
<div id="function-action_button_container" class="shiny-html-output"></div>
<script>if (Tutorial.triggerMathJax) Tutorial.triggerMathJax()</script>
</div>
</div>
<p>Let’s look at a different function.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sum(1,2)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 3</code></pre>
<p>This function, <code>sum</code>, takes in two arguments. As you might
be able to deduce, <code>sum</code> takes the sum of the two numbers.
Notice that we could have just as easily used <code>1+2</code> instead
of using the <code>sum</code> function. Though it didn’t make a
difference here, there are cases when we might prefer to use the
<code>sum</code> function. For example, when you want to take the sum of
a lot of numbers, it might be easier to use sum than having to type out
a lot of <code>+</code> symbols.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-objects" class="section level2">
<h2>Objects</h2>
<div id="section-section-1" class="section level3">
<h3></h3>
<p>When working in R, we very often use something called
<strong>objects</strong>. Objects are simply a way of storing values of
any sort, by assigning a value to a name. For example, we can store a
value of <code>2</code> in the object <code>x</code> using the less than
symbol (<code>&lt;</code>) and dash (<code>-</code>) to create an arrow.
This assigns the value of 2 to <code>x</code>, so that we can access it
and use it without needing to use <code>2</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>x &lt;- 2
x</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 2</code></pre>
<p>This can be very useful if we don’t want to keep writing the same
thing over and over again. It’s less useful for individual numbers such
as <code>2</code>, but we can, for example, use objects to store
<strong>vectors</strong> as well.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-vectors" class="section level3">
<h3>Vectors</h3>
<p><strong>Vectors</strong> are at type of object in R that contain
multiple values. The colon notation is useful for generating vectors for
a range of numbers.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># This creates a vector from 1 to 10.
y &lt;- 1:10
y</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10</code></pre>
<p>We can also create vectors with whatever values we want using the
<code>c</code> function.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>numeric_vector &lt;- c(1,2,6,8,10)
numeric_vector</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1]  1  2  6  8 10</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>text_vector &lt;- c(&#39;this&#39;, &#39;is&#39;, &#39;some&#39;, &#39;text&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>Here, <code>numeric_vector</code> has 5 elements, which are
<code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>6</code>, <code>8</code>, and
<code>10</code>, and <code>text_vector</code> has four elements, which
are the character objects, <code>'this'</code>, <code>'is'</code>,
<code>'some'</code>, and <code>'text'</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Vectors</strong> are actually quite useful in R, because you
can do lots of operations very quickly. For example, if we wanted to
find out what the result of multiplying each number from 1 to 10 by 7
was, we would be able to do so using the following:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>y &lt;- 1:10
y * 7</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  [1]  7 14 21 28 35 42 49 56 63 70</code></pre>
<p>If we wanted to find the sum of all of those numbers, we can use the
<code>sum</code> function as we did before, except with just the vector
this time. We’ll create another object <code>z</code> that contains the
values from 1 to 10 multiplied by 7, then find the sum.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>y &lt;- 1:10
z &lt;- y * 7
sum(z)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 385</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="section-using-the-right-objects" class="section level3">
<h3>Using the Right Objects</h3>
<p>Recall that when we found the sum of two numbers using
<code>sum(1,2)</code>, we used <code>1</code> and <code>2</code> without
quotation marks. This is because we wanted to add up
<strong>numeric</strong> values rather than <strong>character</strong>
values (because it doesn’t make sense to add characters together).
Suppose we tried to run the following.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sum(&#39;1&#39;,&#39;2&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>We would get an error! This is because R is trying to add characters,
which doesn’t make sense. Remember, when programming, we need to be
<strong>very precise</strong> in what we write, because computers are
very bad at interpreting what we want.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-class" class="section level3">
<h3>Class</h3>
<p>One useful for function when you get an error is the
<code>class</code> function. This tells you what type of object
something is.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>test_value &lt;- &#39;1&#39;
class(test_value)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;character&quot;</code></pre>
<p>This can help us identify if there are issues with what we’re trying
to do. For example, if we try to sum up some values, but we get an
error, we can use <code>class</code> to see if the values we are trying
to add up are actually numeric rather than characters.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-additional-r-tools" class="section level2">
<h2>Additional R Tools</h2>
<div id="section-packages" class="section level3">
<h3>Packages</h3>
<p>Many times, we want to use functions that other people have created
and made available. We can do this easily using packages. To use them,
though, you need to first install the package. Most of the packages that
you’ll want to use are available through the Comprehensive R Archive
Network (CRAN). To get a package from CRAN, you can use the
<code>install.packages</code> function.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># An example package is ggplot2
install.packages(&#39;ggplot2&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>To load in a package that you have already installed, you can use the
<code>library</code> function.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(&#39;ggplot2&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>One of the biggest strengths about R is the availability of so many
different tools through these packages, so it’s good to keep in mind
when you’re working with R in the future.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-working-with-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Working with Data</h3>
<p>Generally, you won’t use R to just do arithmetic (although you can
certainly use it a calculator that way if you’d like!). More often,
you’ll actually use it to load datasets and perform analyses on them.
Generally, data are brought into R as data frames. You can learn more
about data frames in the <code>data-frames</code> tutorial, so for now,
we’ll simply go over how you might bring in data.</p>
<p>For the purposes of these tutorials, we’ll generally be using the
<code>data</code> function.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data(&quot;Boston&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>This loads a dataset that was included in a package already. If you
want to bring in your own dataset, you’ll need to load it in. This can
be done from a variety of different formats, such as Excel files, but
the easiest is to use a CSV, or comma-separated value file. To do this,
you’ll have to make sure your working directory is in the same folder as
your data file by going to Session &gt; Set Working Directory &gt;
Choose Directory in RStudio, then navigating to that folder. Then, you
can use the <code>read.csv</code> function.</p>
<p>An equivalent alternative for the above purpose can be to run
<code>setwd()</code> with specifying the working directory path as a
character string inside the function. To check what your current working
directory is you can run <code>getwd()</code> with no argument.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>read.csv(&#39;Boston&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>For these tutorials, we have already pre-loaded data sets for you, so
you won’t need to read in any data using <code>read.csv</code>, but make
sure you keep this in mind in case you want to use R for your own
data!</p>
