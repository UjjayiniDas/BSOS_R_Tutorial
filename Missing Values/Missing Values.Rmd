### Missing values

One of the most common tasks in data analysis is handling missing values. In R, missing values are often represented by the symbol `NA` (not available) or some other value that represents missing values (i.e. `99`).

Impossible values (e.g., dividing by zero) are represented by the symbol `NaN` (not a number).
