## Data Frames

In R, the datasets that you will work with will mainly be in **data frames**. Data frames are just a type of object in R that consists of rows and columns of data, just like you might see in an Excel spreadsheet. For example, we might have a dataset about cars that looks like the following:

```{r}
data("mtcars")
head(mtcars)
```
